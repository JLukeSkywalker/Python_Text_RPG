Basic Modular Text RPG For Teaching

Sets up and runs a basic text adventure rpg with enemies and item drops. 
Very modular. Suggestions would be to use this for teaching. Have students add enemies, classes, items, etc.
Could even add things like equipment, level ups, and graphics with up-down-left-right movement for exploring.

I would suggest coding some of the methods like attack, explore and inventory setup/usage with the students.
I accomplish this by deleting the contents of the methods and giving them the code with those sections as # Insert attack code here ... (for example)
